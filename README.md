# less-to-json-loader

Sometime there is a need to know some variables you've specified in your less files within the scope of your javascript as well.
Maintaining them both in two seperate files is a tedious task and getting them upfront via elements which are just injected into the DOM for this purpose does not seem as pure as one would wish for.

This loader comes to the rescue, assuming you are using the awesome [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as well.
